#FairwayDrivingRangeApp

The purpose is to design an application that will allow a business to manage bookings for a driving range, and manage golf club rental for these bookings if need be. 
The App allows users to book a session at a driving range. Customers are able to choose a timeslot for a session, and decide whether they would like to hire golf clubs for the session as well. 
Admin users are able to look at and edit these bookings, have access to previous bookings made by customers, and add golf clubs to their inventory.
